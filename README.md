Steps to run the system locally

1) clone the repo
2) go inside the clone repo and run the command bundle install
3) The .env file is also in the repo(technically should not be there but since this is a test app and I have used RDS so attached it which I will close in a day or two)
4) run command rails s to run the application
5) open postman and test the APIs
